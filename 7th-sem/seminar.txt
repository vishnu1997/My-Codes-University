Assignment of variable
y = 46

Assignment of vector
x <- c(3,4,"5","6","7","8","9")

Since few elements of the vector is string all are converted into strings 

get a substring of values from a vector
qw = x[4:7]

Convert all the string back into numbers
x <- as.numeric(x)

Summary of vector
z = summary(x)

find mean of a vector
mean()

find median of a vector
median()

find sum of all the elements in a vector
sum()

create a matrix
w1 = matrix(qw,ncol=2)


wq = x[1:4]
w2 = matrix(wq,ncol=2)

Matrix multiplication
w3 = w1%*%w2

Accessing each element in matrix
for(i in 1:dim(w3)[1]){
    for(j in 1:dim(w3)[2]) {
        print(w3[i,j])
    }
}

transpose of a matrix
tran = t(w3)

join two rows 
w4 = rbind(c(1,2,3),c(4,5,6))

join two columns
cbind()

how to read from csv
tab = read.csv("cancer.csv")

how to read if the table has column names
tab = read.csv("cancer.csv",HEADER="True")

access a column in a dataset 
head(iris)
iris$Species
